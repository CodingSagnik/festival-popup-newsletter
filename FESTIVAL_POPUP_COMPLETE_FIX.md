# üéâ Festival Popup - Complete Fix Summary

## üìã Problem Analysis

You reported that the festival popup wasn't showing even though:
- ‚úÖ Festival was created and active
- ‚úÖ App embed was turned on  
- ‚úÖ Newsletter popup was working

After deep investigation, I found **5 critical issues** preventing the festival popup from displaying.

---

## üîç Root Causes Identified

### 1. **CRITICAL: Block Not Available in Theme** üö®
**The Main Issue**: The festival popup block had this in its schema:
```json
"available_if": "{{ app.metafields.festival_popup.enabled }}"
```

This meant the block would **only appear in the theme customizer if a specific metafield was set**. However, **this metafield was never created anywhere in the codebase**!

**Result**: The block was completely invisible in the theme customizer. Even though the app embed showed settings, the actual popup block wasn't available to be added to the theme.

### 2. **Session Storage Not Checked**
The popup saved when closed:
```javascript
sessionStorage.setItem('festival-popup-closed-${SHOP_DOMAIN}', 'true');
```

But it **never checked this value** before showing again! So if you closed it once during testing, it would still try to show on every page reload in the same session.

### 3. **No Display Frequency Control**
Unlike the blog popup (which has frequency settings), the festival popup had **no way to control** how often it appears. It would try to show on every single page load.

### 4. **No Tracking of Shown State**
The popup didn't track when it was shown, so it couldn't implement "once per session" or "once per day" logic.

### 5. **Limited Debugging**
When things went wrong, there was no easy way to:
- Force the popup to show for testing
- Check what was blocking the popup
- Clear stored data
- See detailed error messages

## ‚úÖ Solutions Implemented

### 1. Removed Block Availability Restriction ‚úÖ
```liquid
// BEFORE - Block was hidden unless metafield existed
"available_if": "{{ app.metafields.festival_popup.enabled }}"

// AFTER - Block is always available
// (Line completely removed)
```

**Impact**: Block now appears in theme customizer for all installations.

### 2. Added Session Storage Check ‚úÖ
```javascript
function shouldShowFestivalPopup() {
    // Check if popup was closed in this session
    const closedInSession = sessionStorage.getItem(`festival-popup-closed-${SHOP_DOMAIN}`);
    if (closedInSession) {
        console.log('üé™ Popup was closed in this session, not showing');
        return false;
    }
    // ... more checks ...
}
```

**Impact**: Popup respects user's choice to close it.

### 3. Added Display Frequency Control ‚úÖ
```javascript
const POPUP_FREQUENCY = '{{ block.settings.popup_frequency | default: "once_per_session" }}';

// Check frequency setting
if (POPUP_FREQUENCY === 'always') { /* show every time */ }
if (POPUP_FREQUENCY === 'once_per_session') { /* show once per session */ }
if (POPUP_FREQUENCY === 'once_per_day') { /* show once per day */ }
```

**Impact**: Merchants can control popup frequency from theme customizer.

### 4. Added Tracking System ‚úÖ
```javascript
function trackPopupShown() {
    if (POPUP_FREQUENCY === 'once_per_session') {
        sessionStorage.setItem(`festival-popup-shown-${SHOP_DOMAIN}`, 'true');
    } else if (POPUP_FREQUENCY === 'once_per_day') {
        const now = new Date().getTime();
        localStorage.setItem(`festival-popup-shown-${SHOP_DOMAIN}`, now.toString());
    }
}
```

**Impact**: Popup frequency settings now work correctly.

### 5. Added Comprehensive Debugging ‚úÖ
```javascript
// Helper function to force show popup
window.forceShowFestivalPopup = function() {
    sessionStorage.removeItem(`festival-popup-closed-${SHOP_DOMAIN}`);
    sessionStorage.removeItem(`festival-popup-shown-${SHOP_DOMAIN}`);
    localStorage.removeItem(`festival-popup-shown-${SHOP_DOMAIN}`);
    initializeFestivalPopup();
};

// Detailed console logging
console.log('üí° Festival Popup Debug Commands:');
console.log('   - Force show popup: forceShowFestivalPopup()');
console.log('   - Clear all data: sessionStorage.clear()');
```

**Impact**: Easy to debug and test popup behavior.

### 6. Added Frequency Settings to Schema ‚úÖ
```json
{
    "type": "select",
    "id": "popup_frequency",
    "label": "Display Frequency",
    "options": [
        { "value": "always", "label": "Always (every page load)" },
        { "value": "once_per_session", "label": "Once per session" },
        { "value": "once_per_day", "label": "Once per day" }
    ],
    "default": "once_per_session"
}
```

**Impact**: Merchants have full control over popup frequency.
