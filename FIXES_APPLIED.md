# Fixes Applied - Network Error & Missing "Signed up users" Section

**Commit**: `b232a40`
**Date**: October 27, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. âœ… Network Error on Newsletter Signup
**Problem**: Users were seeing "Network error. Please check your connection and..." when trying to subscribe via the newsletter popup, even with a working internet connection.

**Root Cause**: 
- CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) headers were not properly configured on the API endpoint
- The blog popup's fetch request was being blocked by browser security policies
- Missing proper error logging made debugging difficult

**Solution Implemented**:

#### A. Enhanced API Endpoint (server.js)
- Added CORS headers to `/api/newsletter/subscribe` endpoint
- Added detailed request logging (origin, referer)
- Added proper response headers for cross-origin requests

#### B. Improved Client-Side Error Handling (blog-newsletter-popup.liquid)
- Added `mode: 'cors'` and `credentials: 'omit'` to fetch configuration
- Added comprehensive console logging for debugging
- Enhanced error messages to show server response

**Result**: Newsletter signups now work correctly âœ…

**Features**:
1. Search & Filter Controls

**Result**: Merchants can now see signed-up users in Shopify admin âœ…
