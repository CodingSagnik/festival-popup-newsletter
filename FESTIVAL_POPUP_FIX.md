# Festival Popup Fix - Complete Solution

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. **CRITICAL: Block Not Available in Theme** ‚ùå‚Üí‚úÖ
**Problem**: The festival popup block had an `available_if` condition that required a metafield (`app.metafields.festival_popup.enabled`) that was never created. This prevented the block from appearing in the Shopify theme customizer.

**Fix**: Removed the `available_if` condition so the block is always available.

```liquid
// BEFORE (Block was hidden)
"available_if": "{{ app.metafields.festival_popup.enabled }}"

// AFTER (Block always available)
// Line removed completely
```

### 2. **Missing Session Storage Check** ‚ùå‚Üí‚úÖ
**Problem**: The popup saved when it was closed (`festival-popup-closed-${SHOP_DOMAIN}`) but never checked this value before showing again. This meant once closed, it would show again on next page load in the same session.

**Fix**: Added `shouldShowFestivalPopup()` function that checks session storage before showing.

### 3. **Missing Display Frequency Logic** ‚ùå‚Üí‚úÖ
**Problem**: Unlike the blog popup, the festival popup had no frequency control (once per session, once per day, always).

**Fix**: 
- Added `POPUP_FREQUENCY` configuration
- Added frequency checking logic
- Added `trackPopupShown()` to record when popup was displayed
- Added frequency settings to the schema with 3 options:
  - **Always** (every page load)
  - **Once per session** (default)
  - **Once per day**

### 4. **Better Error Handling** ‚ùå‚Üí‚úÖ
**Problem**: When API failed, the popup would show a fallback which could confuse users.

**Fix**: Removed fallback popup - only shows when actual festival data is available.

### 5. **Enhanced Debugging** ‚ú® NEW
**Added Features**:
- Comprehensive console logging
- Helper function `forceShowFestivalPopup()` for testing
- Debug commands logged on page load
- Clear instructions when popup is closed
