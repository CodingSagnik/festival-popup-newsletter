# 📧 Mailjet Automatic Sender Validation

## Problem Solved

Previously, merchants had to wait for manual validation of their sender emails in Mailjet, which was not feasible for scalability. Now, the validation process is **completely automated**!

## 🚀 How It Works Now

### For Merchants (The Good News!)
1. **Enter email details** in the app's Email Configuration section
2. **Automatically receive validation email** directly in their inbox
3. **Click verification link** in the email from Mailjet
4. **Start sending newsletters immediately** - no waiting for manual approval!

### For You (The Developer)
- **Zero manual intervention required**
- **Automatic sender registration** via Mailjet API
- **Real-time validation status checking**
- **Seamless user experience**

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### New API Endpoints

#### 1. Sender Validation
```
POST /api/mailjet/validate-sender
```
- Automatically adds sender to Mailjet
- Triggers validation email to merchant
- Handles existing senders gracefully

#### 2. Validation Status Check
```
GET /api/mailjet/sender-status/:email
```
- Checks current validation status
- Used for real-time status updates
- Provides feedback to merchants

### Enhanced Email Settings Flow

The existing `/api/shop-settings/:shopDomain/email` endpoint now:
- ✅ Automatically validates Mailjet senders
- ✅ Provides validation feedback to merchants
- ✅ Handles all edge cases (existing senders, already verified, etc.)

## 🎯 User Experience Improvements

### Before (Manual Process)
1. Merchant enters email → ❌ Error: "Email not validated"
2. You manually add email to Mailjet → ⏳ Time consuming
3. You manually send validation email → 📧 Extra step
4. Merchant verifies → ⏳ More waiting
5. You manually approve → ⏳ Final manual step

### After (Automatic Process)
1. Merchant enters email → ✅ Automatic validation triggered
2. Merchant receives email instantly → 📧 Direct to their inbox
3. Merchant clicks verification → ✅ Ready to use immediately

## 📱 Frontend Features
